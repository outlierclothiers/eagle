## 🚀 The Problem We're Solving

The railroad industry spends **$23B+ annually** on maintenance. GPR is critical for ballast assessment—but the analysis process hasn't evolved in decades.

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| ⏱️ **Manual Analysis Bottleneck** | Data acquisition takes hours. Interpretation takes *weeks*. |
| 💰 **Expert Analysts Are Expensive** | Skilled geophysicists command $800-1,500/day |
| 🔮 **Reactive, Not Predictive** | By the time reports arrive, conditions have changed |
| 🔒 **Big Four Lock-In** | Dominant players bundle expensive hardware with labor-intensive services |

## 💡 Our Solution

**Kinetic GPR Pro** is an AI-powered analysis platform that automates the interpretation bottleneck.
